# KU-Hackfest-2023-Energy-Trading

This is the peer-to-peer energy trading network build using blockchain technology. This project is focused to make the energy trading platform. Our system will be mainly based on the simulation of energy trading with the integration of blockchain for transaction and AI to visualize and forecast the energy usage data. We have also simulated the energy transfer mechanism using Internet of Things(IOT).

## Project Focus: Solar Energy and Blockchain
Our project places a spotlight on solar energy, harnessing the power of the energy source to generate electricity. Solar energy is not only abundant but also environmentally friendly. However, efficiently utilizing solar energy has its challenges, especially when it comes to distribution and trading. This is where our innovative solution steps in.

## Simulating Real-World Energy Trading
The core of our project revolves around simulating real-world energy trading scenarios. We aim to create a digital platform that allows users to buy and sell solar-generated energy directly to and from one another. Blockchain technology plays a pivotal role in ensuring the integrity, security, and transparency of these transactions. IOT is used to simulate the transfer of energy.

## Use of AI
AI is used in this project for visualization of the energy usage data. And, also it is used for forecasting of energy usage data. 
## Inspiration
Sustainable energy consumption is no longer just an option; it's a necessity. We were inspired by the urgency to address energy wastage, and inefficiency in energy distribution, and create a more sustainable future. The use of AI and blockchain technology offered a transformative solution, motivating us to embark on "Project Urja."

## What it does
"Project Urja" represents a pioneering effort to leverage AI and blockchain for sustainable energy consumption. Our platform enables transparent, efficient, and peer-to-peer energy trading, with a particular focus on renewable sources like solar energy. It streamlines energy transactions and promotes clean energy adoption.

## How we built it
Building "Project Urja" required a multidisciplinary approach. We integrated AI to visualize the energy usage data and forecast the energy usage data, while blockchain technology ensured secure and transparent transactions with the help of smart contract automation. Our team collaborated closely, employing various programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, smart contracts, and data visualization to bring the platform to life. We also built the IOT to simulate the trade of energy.

## Challenges we ran into
"Project Urja" encountered regulatory complexities, data visualization hurdles, and implementation of secure transactions with blockchain.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our journey with "Project Urja" has been rewarding. We're proud to have created a platform that empowers users to monitor their energy consumption, reduces costs, and promotes sustainable energy consumption. The successful implementation of smart contracts, real-time data feeds, and user-friendly interfaces stands as a testament to our team's dedication and innovation.

## What we learned
Throughout this project, we've learned the invaluable lessons of collaboration, persistence, and adaptability. We've deepened our understanding of blockchain, AI, and their applications in the energy sector. We also gained the knowledge of how IOT works. We would like to thank our mentors for guiding us through the event.

## What's next for Project Urja
"Project Urja" is more than just a concept; it's a vision for a sustainable energy future. Our future prospects for this project will be to automate the smart meter and
